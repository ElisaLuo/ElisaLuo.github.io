                    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>Modern day rocketry certainly has quite the appetite for liquid rocket propellants. While there are numerous types of liquid propellants, all of them share one property in common - they are stored and used as liquids. This characteristic is quite important when it comes to how liquid propellants are used in contrast to other propellants types - the combustion of liquid propellants can be controlled through clever systems that regulate the release of fuel and oxidizer into a combustion chamber. The combustion that takes place here is highly exothermic, and releases enough energy to propel a spacecraft. This is in contrast to solid propellants, whose combustion cannot be dynamically controlled in the same manner since there is no simple method to regulate their release. There are numerous different types of liquid propellants - each with their own unique properties and uses - however, they can still be classified into three groups.</p>

                    <h2>Hypergolics</h2>
                    <p>The premise behind the operation of hypergolic propellants is quite simple. The fuel and oxidizer spontaneously ignite on contact with each other, providing thrust - the simplicity here makes them very easy to control, and very reliable. For this reason, they are commonly used in spacecraft maneuvering systems and reaction control systems, where a high degree of precision is necessary.</p> 

                    <p>Some common hypergolic fuels are:</p>
                    <li>Hydrazine - N2H4</li>
                    <li>Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH) - CH3(NH)NH2</li>
                    <li>Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine (UDMH) - H2NN(CH3)2</li>
                    <li>Aerozine 50 (50% MMH, 50% UDMH)</li>

                    <p>Some common hypergolic oxidizers are:</p>
                    <li>Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO) - N2O4</li>
                    <li>Nitric Acid - HNO3</li>

                    <p>A NTO/MMH combination was used on NASA’s Space Shuttle, in its orbital maneuvering and reaction control systems. More recently, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft uses an NTO/MMH combination to power its Draco and SuperDraco thrusters, which are used for both propulsion and high-precision maneuvers. The spacecraft’s SuperDraco thrusters, specifically, are used in the event of in-flight aborts, and could potentially be used to perform propulsive landings.</p>

                    <h2>Cryogenics</h2>
                    <p>Cryogenic propellants are generally gases at SATP - they must be stored at very low temperatures to be kept in liquid form. Unlike hypergolic propellants, these cryogenic propellants do not spontaneously ignite - and so they require a much more complex engine. However, they are typically much more effective as propellants. Another consideration when it comes to cryogenic fuels is the fact that additional systems are required to chill the cryogenic fuel tanks to the required temperature. Cryogenic fuels have been used on all sorts of space vehicles, typically for propulsion.</p>

                    <p>Some cryogenic fuels include:</p>
                    <li>Liquid Methane - CH4</li>
                    <li>Liquid Hydrogen - H2</li>
                    <li>Liquid Fluorine - F2</li>

                    <p>The most common cryogenic oxidizer, by far, is liquid oxygen (O2), also known as LOX.</p>

                    <p>The combustion of hydrogen and oxygen is highly efficient, and provides one of the highest specific impulses out there. Two notable rockets that have made use of hydrolox (LOX/LH2) combustion are the Saturn V - specifically on its 2nd and 3rd stage J2 engines - and the Space Shuttle - on its RS-25 main engines. These RS-25 main engines burning hydrolox will also be used on NASA’s upcoming SLS.</p>

                    <p>Although the combustion of methane and oxygen is not as efficient, liquid methane is much denser than liquid hydrogen - this reduces the sizes of storage tanks needed to carry it. Future Mars missions may use methane as a fuel as it can be manufactured from Martian resources. Currently, however, although spacecraft using liquid methane are under development, none have actually been to space.</p>

                    <p>Liquid fluorine is quite an effective fuel, however it is also highly reactive and dangerous - for this reason, it is not typically considered for use as a fuel.</p>

                    <h2>Petroleum</h2>
                    <p>Petroleum fuels are highly refined forms of crude oil - they consist of a mixture of hydrocarbons. The petroleum fuel typically used in rockets is known as RP-1 - it is essentially a highly refined form of kerosene. Petroleum fuels are typically burned alongside LOX - since these propellants do not spontaneously ignite, a more complex engine is required (relative to a hypergolic propellant engine). These propellants are less effective than cryogenic propellants, but more effective than hypergolic ones. An advantage of petroleum fuels is the fact that the petroleum fuel tank does not need to be chilled to cryogenic temperatures, as the fuel remains liquid at SATP.

                        RP-1 and LOX have been used on the engines of a number of space vehicles. The most notable is the Saturn V - specifically, on its 1st stage F1 engines. RP-1 has also been used on rockets such as the Atlas/Centaur, as well as the Delta II. More recently, RP-1 has been used on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 Merlin engines, as well as the Centaur V upper stage of the Atlas V rocket (recently used to launch the Perseverance rover to Mars).

                        <h2>Other Fuels</h2>
                        <p>As the most basic requirement of a fuel is that it must be combustible, the options for potential fuels are vast. For example, in the past, rockets such as the Redstone used ethanol as their primary fuel - however, as more efficient fuels were discovered, this practice fell into disuse. Nitrous oxide is commonly used in amateur rocketry - it decomposes exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst.</p>
