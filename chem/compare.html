                    <h2>Ethanol</h2>
                    <p>Ethanol (­C2H6O) is produced from plants such as corn, sugar cane and grains through fermentation. As a fuel, ethanol is commonly blended with gasoline in an 85/15 ethanol to gasoline blend. This blend produces fewer greenhouse gasses and does not contain toxic chemicals like benzene and appears to be a much better alternative to gasoline. However, ethanol production takes up large portions of land and constant growth of the same crop which leads to the erosion and worsens the quality of soil. Furthermore, ethanol costs about $1 per gallon more than petroleum gasoline.

                    <h2>Methane</h2>
                    <p>Liquid methane, CH¬4, is used as a rocket fuel for Space X’s Raptor engine. As of now, no methane-powered rocket has made it to orbit. However, combustion-powered methane engines are being designed to be reused with limited to no refurbishment when the parts return to Earth. This is because methane prevents build-up of debris in the engines compared to hydrocarbon petroleum which allows the engine to have a higher performance while lowering the costs. </p>

                    <h2>Fluorine</h2>
                    <p>Liquid fluorine (-188oC) has successfully been used as a rocket fuel. However, fluorine is an extremely toxic chemical and oxidizer that reacts violently with most substances. Although fluorine mixed with liquid oxygen, can create a high-performance fuel mixture, fluorine’s toxicity has driven away most nations with space programs.</p>

                    <h2>Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine</h2>
                    <p>Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH), (CH3)2NNH2, or 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is a highly toxic chemical that can be used as a rocket fuel. UDMH is a desirable substance to use because of its stability, easy ignition, and high-energy production. However, similarly to hydrazine, concerns about its toxicity, negative health and environmental effects has led to its reduction in usage and has been started to be replaced with fuels such as hydrogen. Countries such as Europe and Japan have eliminated the usage of UDMH while China and Russia plan to stop using UDMH as well.</p>

                    <h2>Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>
                    <p>Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a highly efficient rocket fuel that could be used to replace oxidizers such as nitrogen tetroxide and liquid oxygen. Unlike water, hydrogen peroxide as contains two oxygen atoms, which is needed to burn rocket fuels. Additionally, hydrogen peroxide used in rocket fuel is a 97% hydrogen peroxide and 3% water mix, instead of the store available 3% hydrogen peroxide mix. When the hydrogen peroxide is combined with a catalyst, it produces enough oxygen to combust with alcohol fuels like methanol and ethanol which helps reduce the amount of non-renewable fuels needed to be produced.</p>

                    <h2>Hydrazine</h2>
                    <p>Hydrazine, N2H4, is a highly dangerous substance that can lead to severe damage to the human body. Short term exposure can lead to severe damage of the nervous system and potentially seizures and comas. If an accident were to occur and hydrazine were to fill the air, the fumes from the explosion have been proven to be deadly. In 1960, during a prototype missile launch by the Soviet Union, the hydrazine exploded killing 78 people through a combination of the explosion and deadly fumes. However, hydrazine is still commonly used because it’s a versatile, and reliable rocket fuel that can be stored safely for an indefinite period of time. Some forms can be used as a hypergolic propellant, which is a propellant that will ignite as soon as combined with an oxidizer. It can also be used by itself as a monopropellant where the hydrazine gets passed through a catalyst which instantaneously converts it into hot gas.

                    <h2>Monomethylhydrazine and Dinitrogen Tetroxide</h2>
                    <p>Monomethylhydrazine (MMH), CH3(NH)NH2, is used in the military for missiles and rockets and is used in orbital spacecraft. Compared to UDMH, it has a higher density and has better performance. MMH is formed from the reaction of methylamine (CH3NH2­) and ammonia (NH­3). MMH is used alongside its oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) for orbital maneuvering systems and reaction control systems. MMH and nitrogen tetroxide ignite on contact, so they have to be loaded separately onto a spacecraft carefully and separately over a five-day period.
                        Like UDMH, is a toxic chemical that can cause irritation in the eyes, throat and respiratory system from small, 10-minute exposures. So far, there has been no cases or information on acute lethality towards humans.

                    <h2>Molecular Hydrogen</h2>
                    <p>Liquid hydrogen combined with liquid oxygen is one of the most efficiently known and currently used rocket propellant in the world due to hydrogen being extremely light and powerful, having the lowest molecular weight and burns at 5,500oF. However, to liquify hydrogen and oxygen, both must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Liquid hydrogen is stored at -252oC and must be insulated from all potential sources of heat during flight and storage to prevent it from evaporating or boiling. Liquid hydrogen expands rapidly and absorbs heat which can cause the tank it's stored in to explode. Metals that encounter liquid hydrogen’s cold temperatures can also become brittle and liquid hydrogen is able to leak through welded seams. To contain liquid hydrogen, high costs, insulating techniques are required to maintain the low temperature which makes it impractical for smaller storage and usage purposes.
                        Metallic hydrogen would theoretically be an even more powerful rocket fuel as it would require even higher pressure and lower temperature to contain as a solid. So far however, this has not yet been accomplished, but the possibility of harnessing metallic hydrogen could be a crucial breakthrough in rocket fuel development.
