                    <h2>Hydrazine</h2>
                    <p>Hydrazine, N2H4, is a highly dangerous substance that can lead to severe damage to the human body. Short term exposure can lead to sever damage of the nervous system and potentially seizures and comas. If an accident were to occur and hydrazine were to fill the air, the fumes from the explosion have been proven to be deadly. In 1960, during a prototype missile launch by the Soviet Union, the hydrazine exploded killing 78 people through a combination of the explosion and deadly fumes. However, hydrazine is still commonly used because it’s a versatile, and reliable rocket fuel that can be stored safely for an indefinite period of time. Some forms can be used as a hypergolic propellant, which is a propellant that will ignite as soon as combined with an oxidizer. It can also be used by itself as a monopropellant where the hydrazine get passed through a catalyst which instantaneously converts it into hot gas.

                    <h2>Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine</h2>
                    <p>Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine, (CH3)2NNH2, or 1,1-dimethylhydrazine is a highly toxic chemical that can be used as a a rocket fuel. UDMH is a desirable substance to sue because of its stability, easy ignition, and high-energy production. However, similarly to hydrazine, concerns about its toxicity, negative health and environmental effects has led to its reduction in usage and has been started to be replaced with fuels such as hydrogen. Countries such as Europe and Japan have eliminated the usage of UDMH while China and Russia plan to stop using UDMH as well.</p>

                    <h2>Molecular Hydrogen</h2>
                    <p>Liquid hydrogen combined with liquid oxygen is one of the most efficient known and currently used rocket propellant in the world due to hydrogen being extremely light and powerful, having the lowest molecular weight and burns at 5,500oF. However, to liquify oxygen and oxygen, both must be stored at cryogenic temperatures. Liquid hydrogen is stored at -252oC and must be insulated from all potential sources of heat during flight and storage to prevent it from evaporating or boiling. Liquid hydrogen expands rapidly and absorbs heat which can cause the tank its stored in the explode. Metals that encounter liquid hydrogen’s cold temperatures can also become brittle and liquid hydrogen is able to leak through welded seams. To contain liquid hydrogen high costs, insulating techniques and required to maintain the low temperature which makes it impractical for smaller storage and usage purposes.
                        Metallic hydrogen would theoretically be an even more powerful rocket fuel as it would require even higher pressure and lower temperature to contain as a solid. So far however, this has no yet been accomplished, but the possibility of harnessing metallic hydrogen could be a crucial breakthrough in rocket fuel development.
