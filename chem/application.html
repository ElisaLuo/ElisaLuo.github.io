                    <p>NASA’s SLS (Space Launch System) and SpaceX’s Starship are two upcoming super heavy lift launch vehicles - this means that they fall into a class of rockets that are able to put over 50 metric tons into Low Earth Orbit (LEO).</p>

                    <p>The SLS will be used by NASA as the workhorse of its Artemis program, which aims to put the next humans on the Moon - it will also likely be used in a number of other projects, such as the Lunar Gateway. Much of the technology used by SLS is from the Shuttle era - the goal here for NASA has been to save both money and time by reusing existing technologies. For example, the SLS’s main engines as well as its SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters) are based on their Shuttle equivalents. In contrast to the Shuttle, reusability is not a concern with the SLS - each rocket is disposable, and the central core and SRBs will disintegrate upon reentry into the atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>Starship is being developed with the long-term goal of launching humans and large payloads to Mars. Such a vehicle will play a huge role in the colonization of Mars. In the meantime, Starship will also be able to deliver massive payloads to LEO for a fraction of the current cost. The vehicle is highly innovative, and will accomplish quite a few firsts in rocketry. Part of the reason Starship will be so cost effective is due to its reusability - unlike traditional rockets that jettison spent stages and allow them to disintegrate upon reentry into the atmosphere, Starship will aim to propulsively land its massive first stage booster for reuse. This technology has already been demonstrated on SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket - the first ever orbital rocket to land propulsively.</p>

                    <p>Here, we will analyze the propellant usage of both rockets. In order to do this, we must first take a look at the types of engines and boosters used by each.</p>
                        
                    <p>The SLS consists of a central core flanked by two SRBs. These SRBs are based on the Shuttle’s - the biggest difference is that they each consist of 5 segments in contrast to the Shuttle’s 4. Just like the Shuttle’s, the SLS’s SRBs burn APCP, bound with PBAN. The central core of the SLS consists of two stages - the first stage houses 4 RS-25 engines, burning hydrolox (LOX/LH2) - these engines were also used as the Shuttle’s main engines. Block 1 of the SLS will run a single RL-10 engine on its upper stage, while the more powerful Block 1B will run 4. These RL-10 engines also run on hydrolox, however they are more optimized to perform in the vacuum of space.</p>

                <div class="col-sm" style="margin-left:5%">
                    <p>Starship consists of a first stage and an upper stage that also houses the payload (ie. the upper stage engines are never jettisoned). The entire vehicle uses the same type of engine - SpaceX’s Raptor engine - however the engines on the upper stage are optimized to perform in a vacuum while the engines on the first stage are optimized to perform at sea level. The Raptor engine runs on methalox (LOX/methane) - when it flies on Starship, it will be the first methalox engine used on an orbital rocket.</p>
                        
                    <p>There are a number of factors that come into play here in terms of fuel choices. For one, hydrolox has a higher specific impulse than methalox. However, its density is much lower - this means larger, heavier tanks are required to store it. Hydrolox also requires additional insulation for storage since hydrogen must be stored at a much lower temperature than oxygen - if oxygen was stored at the same temperature as liquid hydrogen, it would freeze solid.</p>
                    <p>The biggest reason for this difference in fuels, however, is due to the fact that methane and oxygen can be manufactured from the Martian atmosphere. For a vehicle such as Starship, which aims to one day serve as a transport between Earth and Mars, this is especially important, as it means that fuel need not be carried for a two-way trip. Rather, methalox can be loaded on Earth for the journey to Mars, and manufactured on Mars in preparation for a return to Earth.</p>

                    <p>Hydrolox powered engines and APCP powered SRBs have also been around for a long time, and so the systems required for their function are well known. The specific engines and boosters used on the SLS have been used in the past on previous rockets, meaning that even more is known about them, and that less testing and development is required. Systems that use methalox, on the other hand, require much more development - this is likely a key reason why the SLS uses hydrolox instead of methalox.</p>
                        
                    <p>Each propellant has its own advantages and disadvantages, and this example really serves to highlight how there really isn’t a single “best propellant”. Rather, the right choice of propellant varies from rocket to rocket based on a number of factors.

            <p>As compared to launching liquid-fueled rockets, solid propellants leave a large carbon footprint due to the combustion of solid rocket fuel. However, although liquid fuels produce “clean” water vapour as exhaust, the production of hydrogen itself can still cause significant carbon emissions. Hazardous clouds from solid propellant rocket launches may also dissipate over land and water sources, causing a greater environmental impact. Launching high speed devices out of the atmosphere has also led to ozone depletion, which could possibly expose Earth to higher amounts of ultraviolet rays from the Sun. Furthermore, even though rocket launches are relatively infrequent, meaning that the overall environmental impact remains much smaller than other fields, such as aviation’s, there has been a steady increase in space-launches recently, such as with SpaceX’s Starlink project. With each failed space mission, space junk is also becoming a growing concern as unused satellites and other objects accumulate in our planet’s orbit.</p>
